# Concurrent-Programming
Implementation of various concurrency methods

In this repository I have shared the various concurrency methods I learnt and implemented during my course on Concurrent Programming. In a nutshell, these files include implementation of various low-level concurrency methods (eg. Semaphore, Monitors, etc), message passing, Future & Promises, Actor framework etc.

<b>Language used: </b> Scala

<b>PS:</b> All these codes cannot be ran as such by simply downloading them. They require a JVM environment to compile and run.
